# Engineering Intern (Praktica)
**Schiffselektronik Rostock**
Rostock, Germany | August 1985 – December 1985

## Summary
Embedded‑systems internship focused on end‑to‑end hardware and firmware development for an academic graduation project.

## Responsibilities
- Gathered and analyzed real‑time system requirements for the graduation project.
- Designed and prototyped hardware modules around the Zilog Z8 single‑chip microcontroller.
- Wrote, debugged, and maintained low‑level firmware in Zilog assembly to drive peripherals and manage timing.
- Performed unit and integration testing to verify real‑time behavior under varying load conditions.
- Created technical documentation including design specifications, test reports, and user manuals.
- Collaborated with academic supervisors and cross‑discipline stakeholders to align on project goals and deliverables.

## Achievements
- Successfully designed and delivered a **real‑time operating system kernel** for the Zilog Z8, including:
  - Preemptive task scheduling meeting sub‑millisecond deadlines
  - Assembly routines for context switching and interrupt handling
  - Basic inter‑process communication primitives
- Produced comprehensive design and test documentation to support future maintenance and extension.

## Significant Project
### Real‑Time OS Kernel for Zilog Z8
- **Scope**: Full architecture and implementation of an RTOS kernel as part of an engineering graduation requirement.
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Preemptive task scheduler meeting sub‑millisecond response targets
  - Interrupt dispatch and context‑switching routines in Zilog assembly
  - IPC primitives for task synchronization

## Skills
- Requirements analysis for real‑time systems
- Embedded hardware prototyping
- Low‑level firmware development in assembly
- Unit and integration testing
- Technical specification and test‑report writing
- Collaboration with academic and engineering teams

## Technologies
- **Microcontroller**: Zilog Z8
- **Language & Toolchain**: Zilog assembly; cross‑assembler
- **Test Equipment**: Oscilloscope; logic analyzer

## Lessons Learned
- Critical importance of rigorous requirements gathering and documentation in real‑time projects.
- Hands‑on experience balancing hardware and firmware integration under strict timing constraints.
- Value of detailed test planning and reporting to ensure predictable system behavior.
