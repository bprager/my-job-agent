1 · North‑Star Vision

Build a Personal Job‑Enhancement System (PJES) that
	•	Internally acts as an always‑on AI career coach/mentor, tracking your goals, surfacing blind spots, and recommending daily micro‑actions.
	•	Externally showcases your expertise through a dynamic public site, a conversational agent, and open interfaces (A2A, MCP) so that recruiters, collaborators, or automated agents can discover, query, and integrate your profile.
	•	Evolves in continuous‑delivery style—each phase is a usable product that demonstrates your leadership in applied AI.

7 · Questions / Assumptions to Confirm
	1.	Do you already have a brand logo / color palette we must follow?
	2.	Which KG data fields should remain private (e.g., salary history)?
	3.	Monthly cloud‑cost ceiling for FinOps guardrails?
	4.	Public chat: Open‑source models only or also GPT‑4o?
	5.	Employer policies on public OSS contributions?
	6.	OK to use third‑party analytics (Plausible/GA) or self‑host only?
	7.	Interest in a community space (Discord/Slack) in addition to A2A?
